## **Data Engineering Project:  Creating Relational Databases and Tbales in PostgreSQL**

This project showcases the implementation of a data engineering solution using Python within a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary objective is to establish a connection with a PostgreSQL database, create three tables (`account_detail`, `personal_detail`, and `location_details`), and define a relational model between these tables, including the establishment of relationships. The project also utilizes the Pandas library to read data from CSV files into DataFrames for further processing.

## **Project Structure**

- **Notebook File**: The core of the project is contained within the Jupyter Notebook file named `data_engineering.ipynb`.
- **Data Files**: The necessary CSV files (`account_data.csv`, `personal_data.csv`, and `location_data.csv`) are provided in the project directory.
- **README**: This README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for replicating the setup and running the notebook.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL connection)
